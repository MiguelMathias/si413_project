# si413_project

SI413 ToDo app, Cupertino Style. Currently hosted at https://si413-project.web.app/

## To Run

To debug in chrome, simply navigate to the base directory and type

`flutter run -d chrome`

## Remarks

Overall, Flutter is an amazing framework to work with. Dart isn't as expressive,
intuitive, or clean as Typescript is with React (in my opinion), but the declarative
style is easy to read, understand, and create with.

## Shortcomings

There's a few bugs I'm vaguely aware of, but for one weekend's work and a first
time experience with Flutter and second time experience with Dart, not bad for
a TodoApp that is completely functional. Firestore data and client side 
data modeling strategy is very naive and not expandable/modular, but it works
for the simplicity of the app. Would've like to add a few more features,
like in the filtered lists having each item's completion button color be its list
color and a few other tweaks of that nature, but overall happy with how it turned
out.
